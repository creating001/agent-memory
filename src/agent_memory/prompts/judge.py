LOCOMO_JUDGE_TEMPLATE = """Your task is to label an answer to a question as 'CORRECT' or 'WRONG'. You will be given the following data:
    (1) a question (posed by one user to another user),
    (2) a 'gold' (ground truth) answer,
    (3) a generated answer
which you will score as CORRECT/WRONG.

The point of the question is to ask about something one user should know about the other user based on their prior conversations.
The gold answer will usually be a concise and short answer that includes the referenced topic. The generated answer might be much longer, but you should be generous with your grading - as long as it touches on the same topic as the gold answer, it should be counted as CORRECT.

For time related questions, the gold answer will be a specific date, month, year, etc. The generated answer might be much longer or use relative time references, but you should be generous with your grading - as long as it refers to the same date or time period as the gold answer, it should be counted as CORRECT.

Now it's time for the real question:
Question: {question}
Gold answer: {gold_answer}
Generated answer: {generated_answer}

Return ONLY a valid JSON object in the following format:
{{
  "label": "CORRECT"
}}

The value of "label" must be exactly "CORRECT" or "WRONG". Do not include any explanation or extra text.
